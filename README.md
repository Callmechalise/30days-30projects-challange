## Calculator Project - Day 1

This is a simple calculator project using the `tkinter` module. It demonstrates the basics of creating a GUI with tkinter and handling user input. The calculator supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and decimal operations.

### Features:
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Error handling for invalid inputs (syntax errors, division by zero)
- Responsive GUI

### Installation:

To run this project, you will need to have Python and the `customtkinter` library installed.

You can install the necessary dependencies with:

```bash
pip install customtkinter
## Usage:
```
1. Clone the repository or download the specific project file.
2. Run the script using Python:

```bash
python calculator.py
```
### Usage Example:
- Press the buttons (0-9, +, -, *, /, ., etc.) to build the mathematical expression.
- Press the "=" button to get the result.
- Use the "clear" button to reset the input field.

### Error Handling:
- If you enter an invalid expression, a `SyntaxError` will be shown.
- If you try to divide by zero, a `ZeroDivisionError` message will be displayed.
- Any other errors will show a generic error message.

#### **CLI To-Do List App (with File Storage)**  
This project is a **command-line To-Do List application** that allows users to add, view, and remove tasks. The tasks are stored in a `todo.txt` file so they persist even after the program is closed.  

---

### **Features:**  
✅ Add new tasks  
✅ View the current task list  
✅ Remove completed tasks  
✅ Save tasks in a `todo.txt` file for persistence

2. **Run the script** using:  
   ```sh
   python Day2.py
   ```
3. Choose an action from the menu:  
   - **1** → Add a new task  
   - **2** → View all tasks  
   - **3** → Remove a completed task  
   - **4** → Exit  

---

### **Example:**  
```sh
Welcome to the CLI To-Do List App!
1. Add Task
2. View Tasks
3. Remove Task
4. Exit
Choose an option: 1
Enter Task: Buy groceries
Task added successfully!

Choose an option: 2

### **Day 3 - GUI Password Generator**  
This project is a **password generator with a GUI** built using `customtkinter`. It allows users to generate **weak or strong passwords** based on different character sets.  

---

### **Features:**  
✅ Generate **weak passwords** (letters + numbers)  
✅ Generate **strong passwords** (letters + numbers + special characters)  
✅ Copy passwords to clipboard  
✅ Clear the password field  

---

### **Installation:**  
Install the required dependencies:  
```sh
pip install customtkinter
```

---

### **Usage:**

2. **Run the script** using:  
   ```sh
   python Day3.py
   ```
3. Click the **"Weak"** or **"Strong"** button to generate a password.  
4. Click **"Clear"** to reset the field.  

---

### **Example GUI:**  
- A **text field** displays the generated password.  
- Three buttons: **"Weak", "Strong", and "Clear"**.  
- The generated password appears instantly when a button is clicked.
